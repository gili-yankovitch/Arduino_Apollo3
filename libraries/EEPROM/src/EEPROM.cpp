  Pseudo-EEPROM on the Cortex-M4F

  https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_Apollo3

  There is no EEPROM built into the Apollo3 Cortex-M4F but we have 1M of flash
  so we carve out the last 8k of flash for EEPROM space. Pages are erased in
  8k chunks so 8k of EEPROM works.

  Flash is 0x00 to 0xFF000. EEPROM writes will start at 0xFF000 - 8192 = 0xF2000.

  Page erase takes 15ms
  Writing a byte takes 19ms
  Writing a float across two words takes 19ms
  Update (no write) takes ~1ms

  Development environment specifics:
  Arduino IDE 1.8.x
